I am using https://github.com/house9/clerk to track creates and updates from users.

The following models are tracked with the above gem:
* app/models/common_name.rb
* app/models/user.rb
* app/models/listing_change.rb
* app/models/trade_restriction.rb
* app/models/distribution.rb
* app/models/event.rb
* app/models/trade/shipment.rb
* app/models/eu_decision.rb
* app/models/trade/annual_report_upload.rb (AF)
* taxon concepts (no views updated)

'Duplicate CITES quotas' (in the batch updates) is tracked with a created_by_id
'Submit shipments' (AF)

The 'raw shipments download' in the trade section and the 'Common Names' download in the admin section have the 'updated by', 'created by' fields.

To run the application you need migrations and to rebuild the following views:
* db/views/shipments_view.sql
* db/views/common_names_view.sql

Also completed:
* eu annex regulation batch copy
* eu suspension regulation batch copy

Remaining:

* taxon commons (note: says no tracking in document, but then tracking expected in admin download, should probably take info from taxon_commons)
* taxon relationships
* references
* taxon concept references
* distribution references
* species_reference_output_view
* standard_reference_output_view
* synonyms_and_trade_names_view
* taxon_concepts_distributions_view
* taxon_concepts_names_view
